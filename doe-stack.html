    <h1>Part 1: Short Answers</h1>

    <article>
        <p class="question">Talk to us about something you’ve helped create. Where did the idea come from? Why does it excite you? What were the highs and lows in the development process? 500 words or less</p>
        
        <p class="answer"><em>Data + Design</em> is a free, Creative Commons-licensed book that introduces data visualization topics using plain language and relatable examples. Everyone who volunteered for this project believes that data visualization is an exciting and powerful way to communicate, so we wanted to create a friendly, inviting resource that encourages people to learn more about dataviz. The chapters I contributed to the most are <a href="https://infoactive.co/data-design/ch17.html" target="_blank">Perception Deception</a> and <a href="https://infoactive.co/data-design/ch18.html" target="_blank">Common Visualization Mistakes</a>. But the fun's not done! I love participating in community-driven projects like this, so thanks to a fantastic team of rock stars who translated the book into French, I'm currently working on getting the <a href="http://bit.ly/datadesignfrench" target="_blank">French version</a> of the book online.</p>

    <h1>Part 2: Task</h1>

    <article>
        <p class="question">Context: The attached file is a “Teacher Summary Report” that is sent to Principals at the end of the school year with information about how their teachers performed across a few evaluation variables. This is a relatively new report that the team has produced and is looking for ways to improve it. Your task is to:</p>

        <p class="question">Create a “report” that represents this data for principals in a clear and engaging way. How you choose to create the report is up to you, including what tools or software you use.</p>

        <p class="answer"></p>

        <p class="question">Explain your methodology and choices made. In less than 500 words describe the assumptions you made, why you made them, what design choices you made, and what influenced them.</p>

        <p class="answer"></p>

        <p class="question">Additionally, describe how you would evaluate the effectiveness of what you produced. Be as specific as possible including both what metrics you would want to measure and how you would define success.</p>

        <p class="answer"></p>

        <p class="question">Last, critique your own product. We know nothing is perfect, and we work continuously to improve, so share two things that you think are really great about what you produced and 2 things that you think could likely be improved over time.</p>
